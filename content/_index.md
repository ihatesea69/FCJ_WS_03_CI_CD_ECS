# Predicting Air Quality Using SageMaker, AutoGluon, and ASDI Open Data

## Overview
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), ambient (outdoor) air pollution leads to an estimated **4.2 million deaths per year**, with **99% of the world’s population** living in areas where air quality exceeds WHO limits. This workshop demonstrates how to use **Amazon SageMaker**, **AutoGluon**, and open datasets from the **Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI)** to predict air quality based on weather conditions.

## Objectives
In this workshop, you will:
- Investigate the relationship between **air quality** and **weather** using **Amazon SageMaker Studio**.
- Access open data from **ASDI** via **Amazon S3** and **HTTP APIs** to explore air quality by location.
- Deploy a machine learning model using **AutoGluon** (open-source AutoML supported by AWS) to predict how weather features result in **healthy** vs. **unhealthy** air quality.
- Experiment with different scenarios (new locations, air quality parameters) and improve the model with your own code.
- Analyze how **location**, **wind speed**, and **seasonality** correlate with air quality, using historical data to predict air quality under specific conditions.

This workshop provides **step-by-step instructions** and code examples for each task. It is suitable for participants with no prior knowledge of machine learning or air quality prediction.

## Importance
As highlighted, nearly all of the global population (99%) lives in areas where air quality exceeds WHO limits. Poor air quality is associated with an increased risk of:
- **Stroke**
- **Heart disease**
- **Lung cancer**
- **Asthma**
- **Other respiratory diseases**

Beyond individual health, poor air quality affects communities and economies. Addressing this issue with **data-driven solutions** is essential for improving public health outcomes.

## Available AWS Resources
AWS offers a range of tools and datasets to help tackle environmental challenges:
- **Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI)**: A collection of sustainability-focused datasets available on AWS, hosting over 100 petabytes of open data.
- **AWS Data Exchange**: A marketplace to access both open and licensable data.
- **Amazon SageMaker**: Provides tools to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale.

## The Role of Citizen Developers
**Citizen developers**—individuals who use programming or low-code/no-code tools—are key to solving real-world problems. With advancements in technology, citizen developers can easily apply tools like **AutoML** to explore datasets and build meaningful solutions. This workshop is a great example of how citizen developers can contribute to global initiatives like **"tech for good"** by participating in hackathons or side projects.

## Workshop Agenda
Participants will:
1. Explore the relationship between weather and air quality.
2. Utilize open datasets across all **ASDI** categories, including:
   - Weather
   - Climate
   - Water
   - Agriculture
   - Satellite imagery
   - Air quality
   - Energy
   - Disaster response
   - Ecosystems
3. Build, deploy, and improve a machine learning model using SageMaker and AutoGluon.

## Time Required
This workshop will take approximately **2 hours** to complete.

## Learn Today, Build Tomorrow!
Take what you learn in this workshop and apply it to new problems. Explore the vast array of open datasets available through ASDI and AWS to build solutions in various domains, from climate science to public health.
