Verify your phone number Choose your country or region code from the list. Enter a phone number where you can be reached in the next few minutes. Enter the code displayed in the CAPTCHA, and then submit. In a few moments, an automated system contacts you. Enter the PIN you receive, and then choose Continue. Choose an AWS Support plan On the Select a Support Plan page, choose one of the available Support plans. For a description of the available Support plans and their benefits, see Compare AWS Support Plans. Wait for your account to be activated After you choose a Support plan, a confirmation page indicates that your account is being activated. Accounts are usually activated within a few minutes, but the process might take up to 24 hours. You can sign in to your AWS account during this time. The AWS home page might display a Complete Sign Up button during this time, even if you\u0026rsquo;ve completed all the steps in the sign-up process. Once your account is fully activated, you will receive a confirmation email. Check your email and spam folder for the confirmation email. After you receive this email, you have full access to all AWS services.\n"

	"content": "Predicting Air Quality Using SageMaker, AutoGluon, and ASDI Open Data Overview According to the World Health Organization (WHO), ambient (outdoor) air pollution leads to an estimated 4.2 million deaths per year, with 99% of the world’s population living in areas where air quality exceeds WHO limits. This workshop demonstrates how to use Amazon SageMaker, AutoGluon, and open datasets from the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) to predict air quality based on weather conditions.\nObjectives In this workshop, you will:\nInvestigate the relationship between air quality and weather using Amazon SageMaker Studio. Access open data from ASDI via Amazon S3 and HTTP APIs to explore air quality by location. Deploy a machine learning model using AutoGluon (open-source AutoML supported by AWS) to predict how weather features result in healthy vs. unhealthy air quality. Experiment with different scenarios (new locations, air quality parameters) and improve the model with your own code. Analyze how location, wind speed, and seasonality correlate with air quality, using historical data to predict air quality under specific conditions. This workshop provides step-by-step instructions and code examples for each task. It is suitable for participants with no prior knowledge of machine learning or air quality prediction.\nImportance As highlighted, nearly all of the global population (99%) lives in areas where air quality exceeds WHO limits. Poor air quality is associated with an increased risk of:\nStroke Heart disease Lung cancer Asthma Other respiratory diseases Beyond individual health, poor air quality affects communities and economies. Addressing this issue with data-driven solutions is essential for improving public health outcomes.\nAvailable AWS Resources AWS offers a range of tools and datasets to help tackle environmental challenges:\nAmazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI): A collection of sustainability-focused datasets available on AWS, hosting over 100 petabytes of open data. AWS Data Exchange: A marketplace to access both open and licensable data. Amazon SageMaker: Provides tools to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale. The Role of Citizen Developers Citizen developers—individuals who use programming or low-code/no-code tools—are key to solving real-world problems. With advancements in technology, citizen developers can easily apply tools like AutoML to explore datasets and build meaningful solutions. This workshop is a great example of how citizen developers can contribute to global initiatives like \u0026ldquo;tech for good\u0026rdquo; by participating in hackathons or side projects.\nWorkshop Agenda Participants will:\nExplore the relationship between weather and air quality. Utilize open datasets across all ASDI categories, including: Weather Climate Water Agriculture Satellite imagery Air quality Energy Disaster response Ecosystems Build, deploy, and improve a machine learning model using SageMaker and AutoGluon. Time Required This workshop will take approximately 2 hours to complete.\nLearn Today, Build Tomorrow! Take what you learn in this workshop and apply it to new problems. Explore the vast array of open datasets available through ASDI and AWS to build solutions in various domains, from climate science to public health.\nReferences World Health Organization (WHO): Ambient (Outdoor) Air Pollution Fact Sheet Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) Open Data on AWS AWS Data Exchange "
